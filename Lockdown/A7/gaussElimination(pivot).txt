1. Start 
2. for i : 1 to n 
            for k : 1 to i-1 & i+1 to n
                multiply all elements of i th row with A[k][i] 
                multiply all elements of k th row with A[i][i]
                Ak = Ai - Ak (Ak is all elements of kth row)
                this makes A[k][i] = 0 
        

3. Only diagonal elements are left
